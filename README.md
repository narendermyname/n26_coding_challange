# N26 Hacker Rank Coding Challange

Got below negative feedback.
 - not efficient thread-safe structure(copy-on-write-list and then iteration over the whole history of transactions)
 - not enough checks in tests: lacking of assertions on actual values
 -  validator returns http codes
 - not good separation of concerns, yields to non-clean code
 - no memory cleanup
 
 Need minimum 80% score to pass this coding round
